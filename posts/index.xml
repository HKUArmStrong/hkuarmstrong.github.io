&lt;p>Our team is dedicated to exploring and advancing the field of robotics, with a focus on innovative projects and collaborative learning. We aim to provide a platform for students to engage in hands-on experiences and develop their skills in robotics and related technologies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Student Competition: Game Rules</title><link>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/notice_student-competition_01_rules/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:11:02 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/notice_student-competition_01_rules/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="-robot-arm-challenge-2025--game-rules">🤖 Robot Arm Challenge 2025 – Game Rules&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="-about-the-challenge">📢 About the Challenge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Robot Arm Challenge 2025&lt;/strong> is a &lt;strong>bin-picking robotics competition&lt;/strong> where participants will build a fully automated system capable of sorting items of different shapes, colors, and sizes within a given time. Hosted by the &lt;strong>HKU Armstrong Team&lt;/strong> at &lt;strong>Tam Wing Fan Innovation Wing One, HKU&lt;/strong>, this competition provides an exciting platform for students to &lt;strong>apply their robotics and AI skills&lt;/strong> in a real-world challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upcoming Student Competition: Random Bin Picking Task</title><link>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/notice_student-competition_00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:35:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/notice_student-competition_00/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are excited to announce that we will be launching a student competition focused on a random bin picking task using the Dobot Magician robotic arm. This competition aims to challenge students to develop innovative solutions for robotic manipulation and automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for more information on the competition details, rules, and how to participate. We look forward to seeing the creative and effective solutions that students will bring to this challenge!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Constraint-adaptive Shared-autonomy System</title><link>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/hri2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 17:55:28 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/hri2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are excited to announce that our work on the &amp;ldquo;Constraint-adaptive Shared-autonomy System&amp;rdquo; has been accepted for publication as a Student Design Challenge submission at the &lt;a href="https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2025/">2025 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction&lt;/a> (HRI 2025).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system aims to enhance human-robot interaction by adapting to various constraints in real-time, providing a more intuitive and efficient shared-autonomy experience.&lt;/p>
