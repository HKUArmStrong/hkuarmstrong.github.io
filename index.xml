This package provides a straightforward interface to control the robot arm. The package has been tested with ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04 to ensure compatibility and functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please refer our open-source repository for the ROS package: &lt;a href="https://github.com/HKUArmStrong/dobot_magician_ros">DOBOT Magician ROS Package&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

This project is designed to aid in teaching and provide a hands-on learning experience for students interested in robotics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The repository includes various example codes to help users understand and control the WidowX-250s robotic arm using Python. These materials are intended to be accessible and educational, making it easier for students to get started with robotic programming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Announcing the Founding of HKU ArmStrong Team</title><link>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/founding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 17:55:28 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/founding/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are pleased to announce the founding of the HKU ArmStrong team, a student interest group in the HKU Innovation Wing, founded by Ian Lo, Nafis UI, and Yoko Lau.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our team is dedicated to exploring and advancing the field of robotics, with a focus on innovative projects and collaborative learning. We aim to provide a platform for students to engage in hands-on experiences and develop their skills in robotics and related technologies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upcoming Student Competition: Random Bin Picking Task</title><link>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/notice_student-competition_00/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:35:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/notice_student-competition_00/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are excited to announce that we will be launching a student competition focused on a random bin picking task using the Dobot Magician robotic arm. This competition aims to challenge students to develop innovative solutions for robotic manipulation and automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for more information on the competition details, rules, and how to participate. We look forward to seeing the creative and effective solutions that students will bring to this challenge!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Constraint-adaptive Shared-autonomy System</title><link>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/hri2025/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 17:55:28 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://hkuarmstrong.github.io/posts/hri2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are excited to announce that our work on the &amp;ldquo;Constraint-adaptive Shared-autonomy System&amp;rdquo; has been accepted for publication as a Student Design Challenge submission at the 2025 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2025).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system aims to enhance human-robot interaction by adapting to various constraints in real-time, providing a more intuitive and efficient shared-autonomy experience.&lt;/p>
